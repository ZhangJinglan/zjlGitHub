Welcome to the CAB230 wiki!

According to Lachlan's suggestions, we should teach GitHub in CAB230 as it is an essential skill web developers should have. 
This need is also reflected in our recent Pulse survey.   I'll add a few slides about GitHub in the lecture notes and provided several references so students can read and practice at their own time.  Next year we can teach GitHub in Week3 or Week4. 

Please feel free to add any comments.
